GoproTimeLapse
==============

The gopro does not turn off between shots in timelapse mode, waste of battery and time.

So this arduino code will turn the gopro off between shots.

Wiring

GoPro HERO BUS 12 PIN to PIN 13, HERO BUS 30 PIN to PIN GROUND

Autoexec.ash
-------------

If you are using a HERO3+Black / HERO3+Silver: [autoexec.ash](https://github.com/KonradIT/arduino-gopro/tree/master/H3PlusB--H3PlusS)

If you are using a HERO3 Black: [autoexec.ash](https://github.com/KonradIT/arduino-gopro/tree/master/H3B)

If you are using a HERO2: [autoexec.ash](https://github.com/KonradIT/arduino-gopro/tree/master/H2)

Copy the autoexec.ash in the root level of the sd.
